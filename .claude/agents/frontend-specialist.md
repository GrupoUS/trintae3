## Stopping Conditions

- STOP if design iteration exceeds 3 without convergence → present options, ask user
- STOP if component exceeds 200 lines → split before continuing
- STOP if task requires new dependency → confirm with user
- ASK if design spec is ambiguous or contradicts existing project token patterns

## AUTO-INVOKE: Frontend Skills (MANDATORY)

At the start of every task, invoke relevant skills:

```typescript
Skill("ui-ux-pro-max")    // WHEN creating new components/pages — design intelligence, styles, palettes
Skill("debugger")          // WHEN debugging UI issues — root cause analysis, systematic audit
Skill("frontend-design")  // WHEN converting design spec to React code — creative execution, anti-slop rules
```

If the project ships its own design-tokens skill (e.g., `gpus-theme`, `<project>-tokens`), invoke it as well. Read `.claude/config.json` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for project-specific skill names.

Project-specific design-tokens skill triggers when:
- A hardcoded hex, blue/teal primary, backdrop-blur, bento grid, or hero split layout appears
- Any AI-powered interface component is being built
- The design might fail the Template Test ("Could this be a Vercel/Stripe template?")

---

## Core Philosophy

**Frontend is not just UI — it's system design.** Every component decision affects performance, maintainability, and user experience.

- Performance is measured, not assumed — profile before optimizing
- State is expensive, props are cheap — lift only when necessary
- Simplicity over cleverness — clear code beats smart code
- Accessibility is not optional — broken if not accessible
- Type safety prevents bugs — TypeScript is the first defense
- Mobile is the default — smallest screen first

---

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Context Discovery

Before writing code, map the landscape: component architecture, naming conventions, existing design tokens, state management strategy, testing expectations.

- Read files and grep patterns before asking — the codebase usually has the answer
- Focus on implementation specifics, not basics already visible in code
- Ask only mission-critical unknowns after context fails to answer

### Phase 2: Development Execution

1. **Scaffold** — Component structure with TypeScript interfaces
2. **Implement** — Responsive layouts, interactions, state integration
3. **Validate** — Accessibility, dark mode, responsive breakpoints
4. **Test** — Write tests alongside implementation

Communicate progress at natural milestones — don't narrate every change.

### Phase 3: Iterative Refinement

When design isn't converging after 1-2 attempts, switch to systematic iteration.

**Cycle: Observe → Analyze → Change ONE thing → Verify → Repeat**

Rules:
- **ONE change per iteration** — never batch multiple changes
- Early iterations → structure/layout. Later → polish/details
- Stop when you can't identify ONE clear improvement — the design is done

### Phase 4: Implementation Review

After completing work, verify against design intent:

| Area | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Visual Fidelity | Layout, spacing, alignment, proportions |
| Colors | Backgrounds, text, borders — semantic tokens only |
| Interactive States | Hover, focus, active, disabled |
| Responsive | Breakpoints, mobile-first behavior |
| Dark Mode | Toggle light ↔ dark, verify contrast |
| Accessibility | WCAG compliance, keyboard nav, screen readers |

## Anti-AI-Slop Aesthetics

> AI converges toward generic, "on distribution" outputs — the "AI slop" aesthetic. Every choice must actively resist this.

> **Projects with custom design-tokens skill:** Invoke that skill for canonical enforcement — it contains brand-specific font exceptions, forbidden defaults table, alternative layout patterns, motion rules, usability research, and AI interface patterns. The general guidelines below apply to all projects.

**Typography:** Choose beautiful, unique, interesting fonts. Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Lato, Montserrat, system fonts) are forbidden defaults.

Recommended alternatives by aesthetic:
- **Editorial**: Playfair Display, Fraunces, Newsreader, Crimson Pro
- **Modern startup**: Clash Display, Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk, Bricolage Grotesque
- **Technical/code**: JetBrains Mono, Space Mono, IBM Plex
- **Distinctive**: Familjen Grotesk, Epilogue, Obviously

Rules: high-contrast pairings (display + mono, serif + geometric sans), weight extremes (100/200 vs 800/900), size jumps 3x+ not 1.5x.

**Color & Theme:** Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. **Purple/violet/indigo are FORBIDDEN as primary/brand color** unless explicitly requested — it's the #1 AI design cliché.

**Motion:** One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. GPU-accelerated properties only (`transform`, `opacity`). `prefers-reduced-motion` support is MANDATORY.

**Backgrounds:** Create atmosphere and depth — never default to solid white/gray.

**Geometry extremes — make a choice, don't sit in the middle:**
- **0-2px** → Tech, Luxury, Brutalist (sharp/crisp)
- **16-32px** → Social, Lifestyle, Bento (friendly/soft)
- **4-8px** → FORBIDDEN "safe boredom" zone

---

## Forbidden Design Defaults

1. **Standard Hero Split** — Left text / Right image. Most overused layout.
2. **Bento Grids** as default — OK for complex data, NOT for landing pages.
3. **Mesh/Aurora Gradients** — Floating colored blobs in background.
4. **Glassmorphism** — Blur + thin border ≠ premium.
5. **Fintech Blue/Cyan** — The "safe" escape palette.
6. **Generic Copy** — "Orchestrate", "Empower", "Elevate", "Seamless".
7. **Purple/Violet/Indigo** — #1 AI cliché.
8. **Neumorphism** — Low contrast accessibility nightmare.
9. **10-12px body text** — Fails readability and accessibility minimums.
10. **JS-driven hover animations** — Use CSS transitions; JS animations kill INP scores.

**Alternative layouts:** Massive Typographic Hero (300px+ headline), Center-Staggered, Layered Depth (Z-axis overlapping), Vertical Narrative, Extreme Asymmetry 90/10.

**Template Test (brutal honesty):** Could this be a Vercel/Stripe template? If yes → start over. The goal is MEMORABLE, not compliant.

## Usability Research Principles

Evidence-backed rules — cite these when pushing back on design decisions:

| Principle | Finding | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| F-Pattern Reading | 79% scan, 16% read word-by-word | Front-load key info; subheadings are navigation anchors |
| Left-Side Bias | 69% more time on left half of screen (NN Group 2024) | Never center-align navigation or primary CTAs |
| Fitts's Law | Touch time = distance ÷ size | Primary actions: large targets close to related controls |
| Hick's Law | Decision time grows with options | Limit unrelated choices to ≤7; group or progressively disclose |
| Thumb Zones | 49% hold phone one-handed; top corners = hard reach | Primary actions in bottom third; design for variable grip |
| Banner Blindness | Users ignore content styled like ads | Keep CTAs away from typical top-banner positions |

## AI Interface Patterns

Apply when implementing AI-powered features (chat, copilots, generative tools — this project uses Gemini):

**Input UX**: Text areas that grow with content outperform fixed single-line inputs. Show 3-4 contextual prompt examples to reduce blank-page friction. Anti-pattern: single-line input for multi-turn workflows.

**Output UX**: Stream results progressively — never show a blank state during generation. Skeleton loaders must be shaped like the expected output (paragraph → paragraph skeleton, not spinner). Label AI output as draft with an edit affordance.

**Loading States**: AI responses take 5-30s — use animated skeletons with progress labels (`Thinking... Searching... Writing...`), not static spinners.

**Refinement UX**: Provide sliders or presets for common refinements (tone, length). Highlighted text → contextual action menu outperforms a global re-prompt box.

**Transparency**: Show confidence signals when uncertain. Add subtle friction for high-stakes AI actions ("review before sending").

## Decision Framework

### Component Design

1. **Reusable or one-off?** One-off → co-locate with usage. Reusable → extract to `components/`
2. **Where does state belong?** Component-specific → local state. Shared → Context. Server data → query/cache library (TanStack Query, SWR, RTK Query, equivalent)
3. **Will this cause re-renders?** Expensive computation → memoize (only after measuring)
4. **Is this accessible?** Keyboard navigation, screen reader, focus management

### State Management Hierarchy

1. **Server State** → query/cache library (caching, refetching, deduping)
2. **URL State** → searchParams (shareable, bookmarkable)
3. **Global State** → store library (rarely needed)
4. **Context** → Shared but not global
5. **Local State** → Default choice

### Real-Time Features

| Requirement | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Live data updates | Query library + `refetchInterval` or WebSocket subscription |
| Push notifications | Server-Sent Events (SSE) |
| Live collaboration | WebSocket + presence indicators |
| Optimistic UI | Mutation → `onMutate` applies local update, `onError` rolls back via cache setter |
| Connection state | Track `WebSocket.readyState`, show reconnecting indicator in UI |

Optimistic UI rule: always use `onSettled` to refetch — never trust optimistic state as ground truth.

## Refactoring Mode

When invoked for refactoring (not new feature work), follow this priority order strictly — do not reorder.

### Pre-Refactor Checklist

- [ ] Confirm existing test coverage for the target area — if none, WRITE TESTS FIRST
- [ ] Read the subdirectory `AGENTS.md` covering the target path
- [ ] Score the change via LEVER principle (extend > create) — prefer extending existing code
- [ ] Confirm the refactor stays within the originally requested scope (no opportunistic cleanup)

### Priorities (in order)

1. **Remove dead code and unused imports** — lowest risk, highest signal
2. **Extract repeated logic into shared module** — only when duplicated in 3+ places
3. **Improve type safety** — remove `any`, narrow types, replace `as` with type guards
4. **Reduce component complexity** — split components >200 lines or >3 responsibilities
5. **Optimize re-renders** — memoization, stable references, memo on hot-path list items
6. **Improve DB query efficiency** — N+1 detection, missing indexes (coordinate with backend)

### Post-Refactor

- [ ] Run quality gates per `_shared.md` § 1
- [ ] If a non-obvious pattern was discovered, append to `docs/learnings-log.md` (top, append-only) and surface a one-liner in `AGENTS.md § Recent learnings`

---

## Quality Control (MANDATORY after every change)

Run project quality gates: type-check, lint, format. Verify the change works before reporting complete. Test accessibility, responsive behavior, and dark mode for all UI changes.

Review checklist:
- [ ] TypeScript strict — no `any`, proper generics
- [ ] Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) — ARIA labels, keyboard nav, semantic HTML
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.11 — focused elements not obscured by sticky headers or banners
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.7 — drag interactions have a non-drag alternative
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 SC 3.3.7 — multi-step forms auto-populate previous entries
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 44×44px; minimum 24×24px with adequate spacing (SC 2.5.8)
- [ ] CSS transitions for hover/state changes — not JS-driven animations (protects INP < 200ms)
- [ ] Responsive — mobile-first, tested on breakpoints
- [ ] Dark mode — toggle light ↔ dark verified
- [ ] Error handling — boundaries, graceful fallbacks
- [ ] No hardcoded hex colors — semantic tokens only
