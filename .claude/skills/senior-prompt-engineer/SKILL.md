description: Canonical contract for Claude Code subagent design, handoff schemas, orchestrator spawn templates, parallel-batch return contracts, and coordinator failure-recovery rules. Use when authoring or editing .claude/agents/*.md, designing multi-agent commands in .claude/commands/, building handoff schemas, or when a parallel batch needs a shared return contract. Also covers prompt engineering for application-level LLM features (RAG, structured outputs, eval harnesses).

# Senior Prompt Engineer — Claude Code Agent Orchestration SSOT

> Single source of truth for **how Claude Code agents talk to each other**.
> Anchored to Anthropic official docs (sub-agents, skills) — see `references/agentic_system_design.md`.
> Project-agnostic: examples use placeholders. Host project supplies stack-specific rules via `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/rules/`.

## 1. Purpose & scope

This skill governs three things:

1. **Subagent design** — what every `.claude/agents/*.md` file must look like (frontmatter + body sections).
2. **Inter-agent handoff** — the canonical structured shape every agent returns and the 5 mandatory context fields every spawn injects.
3. **Multi-agent orchestration** — parallel-batch return contracts, coordinator failure-recovery, escalation paths.

Out of this skill's scope: domain knowledge (lives in project-specific skills — framework, design system, brand voice, debugger, performance, etc.). Application-level prompt engineering (RAG / few-shot / CoT / evals) is documented here only as a pointer to references.

---

## 2. Subagent file contract

Every `.claude/agents/<name>.md` must follow this shape:

```markdown
---
name: <unique-lowercase-hyphens>
description: <when Claude should delegate — front-load use case>
tools: <allowlist>                    # OR `disallowedTools` — see references/agentic_system_design.md § 4
model: opus | sonnet | haiku | inherit
skills: [<skill-name>, …]             # optional preload — see § 8 below
permissionMode: default | plan | …    # optional — Anthropic spec
maxTurns: <int>                       # optional cap
isolation: worktree                   # optional sandbox
color: <ui hint>
---

# <Agent Name>

## Role
[One paragraph — who the agent is, what it owns.]

## Iron Laws
[Non-negotiable invariants — bullet list, ≤ 7 items.]

## Phases
[Numbered execution flow. Each phase produces a checkpoint artifact.]

## Handoff Format
[ONE LINE pointer to `references/agent-handoff-contracts.md`. Do not redeclare schema.]

## Stopping Conditions
[Explicit triggers for `BLOCKED` / escalation. Always include max-attempts limit.]
```

**Required fields:** `name`, `description`. Everything else has a default per Anthropic spec.

**Forbidden in body:**
- Re-declaring the Context Handoff schema (it lives in `references/agent-handoff-contracts.md`).
- Re-declaring the 5-field spawn template (same).
- Repeating content from a preloaded skill (waste of context budget).
- Hardcoded project-specific values that belong in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/rules/` / `.claude/config.json` — agents inherit the same project rules as commands.

---

## 3. Description guidelines (auto-trigger reliability)

Per Anthropic skills doc, descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available. They power both:

1. **Auto-invocation** — Claude reads descriptions to decide when to delegate.
2. **The `/agents` Library tab** — humans browse by description.

Rules:

- **Front-load the key use case.** Anthropic doc: "Front-load the key use case: the combined `description` and `when_to_use` text is truncated at 1,536 characters."
- **Include trigger phrases** — "Use when…", "Triggers on…", literal user-language tokens.
- **Be specific.** Generic descriptions ("World-class X for Y") don't auto-trigger — Anthropic explicitly warns this in the troubleshooting section.
- **Stay under 1,536 chars** combined with `when_to_use`.
- **Distinguish similar agents** — `explorer` (codebase-only) vs. `librarian` (external-only) must have descriptions that prevent overlap.

Bad: `"Powerful research agent."`
Good: `"Internal codebase researcher. Use proactively when planning any feature, investigating code structure, or needing to understand existing patterns and conventions. Triggers automatically on research, discovery, impact analysis. NEVER searches the internet."`

---

## 4. Spawn template (5 mandatory context fields)

Every `Agent()` / `Task()` invocation MUST inject these fields. Promoted from `orchestrator.md` to canonical SSOT.

```markdown
## MANDATORY CONTEXT
**Original request:** <verbatim user message>
**User decisions:** <approach choices made so far>
**Prior agent findings:** <1-2 sentence summary per completed agent>
**Current plan state:** <phase N, task X of Y>
**Do NOT redo:** <what prior agents already covered>
```

**Why:** agents without context rediscover what the parent already knows — wastes tokens, conflicts with prior decisions, multiplies parallel-spawn overhead.

Full semantics + edge cases: `references/agent-handoff-contracts.md § 1`.

**Commands MUST link to that file** rather than duplicating the field list — single SSOT.

---

## 5. Handoff Contract Schema

Every agent returns the canonical Context Handoff block (markdown) — and a JSON variant for `/verify` consolidator tooling.

Full schema, status semantics, invariants, anti-patterns: **`references/agent-handoff-contracts.md`**.

Quick reference:

```markdown
## Context Handoff
- **Status:** COMPLETED | BLOCKED | REVISION_REQUIRED
- **Confidence:** 1-5
- **Artifacts:** [{ path, lines, action }]
- **Quality gates:** [{ name, status, evidence }]
- **Decisions:** [{ what, why }]
- **Risks:** [{ desc, mitigation }]
- **Next agent:** <name> | NONE
- **Resume hint:** <one sentence>
```

Hard rules:
1. `confidence < 3` on critical finding → status MUST be `BLOCKED`.
2. `BLOCKED` requires `risks[].mitigation` (or `mitigation: "ESCALATE"`).
3. `REVISION_REQUIRED` is reviewer-only.
4. `Quality gates: []` is a defect on `COMPLETED` (no evidence = no claim).

---

## 6. Parallel-batch shared contract

When ≥2 agents spawn in one message (parallel pattern, `_shared.md § 7`), every member returns the standard Context Handoff PLUS a shared **findings table** with these exact columns:

```markdown
| # | Finding | Confidence (1-5) | Source | Impact (Low/Med/High) |
```

Review batches add a 6th column: `Severity (P0-P3)`.

Full consolidation rules, severity scale, tool-precedence, max batch size: **`references/parallel-batch-contracts.md`**.

Hard rules:
1. Same column order across all batch members — consolidation must be mechanical.
2. Each agent investigates a non-overlapping area (otherwise merge into one).
3. Max 5 spawns per user request (per `CLAUDE.md § Stopping conditions`).

---

## 7. Coordinator failure recovery

When an agent-team coordinator (`/implement § 6`) receives `REVISION_REQUIRED` from a specialist:

1. **Iteration 1:** forward reviewer failures to specialist; specialist resubmits.
2. **Iteration 2:** if still `REVISION_REQUIRED`, forward once more — last attempt.
3. **Would-be iteration 3:** coordinator does NOT retry. Returns `BLOCKED: <criterion>` to main agent. Main invokes `/debug recover`.

**Never escalate to user mid-loop.** `/debug recover` triages first.

Same rule applies recursively if a coordinator delegates to another coordinator (rare in this repo).

Full recovery semantics: `references/agent-handoff-contracts.md § 4`.

---

## 8. Skill preload pattern (`skills:` frontmatter)

> Anthropic doc: "Subagents don't inherit skills from the parent conversation; you must list them explicitly. The full content of each skill is injected into the subagent's context, not just made available for invocation."

Two ways for an agent to use a skill:

| Pattern | When | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Preload** (`skills: [<name>]` in frontmatter) | Skill **always** needed (every invocation). Process skills (planning, debugging methodology, agent-orchestration). | Body injected once at startup |
| **Body-level `Skill()` call** | Skill **conditionally** needed (depends on routing). Domain skills (framework-specific, design system, brand voice). | Body loaded only when invoked |

**Rule of thumb:** if removing the skill would break >50% of the agent's invocations → preload it.

**Precondition for preloading:** target skill must NOT have `disable-model-invocation: true` in its frontmatter (Anthropic constraint — silently skipped otherwise).

**Default assignments (adapt per host project):**

| Agent role | Preloaded skills (typical) |
|---|---|
| Orchestrator (multi-agent coordinator) | `senior-prompt-engineer`, `planning`, plus any session-memory skill |
| Project planner | `senior-prompt-engineer`, `planning` |
| Evaluator / reviewer | `senior-prompt-engineer` |
| Debugger | project's debugging methodology skill, `senior-prompt-engineer` |

Domain / leaf agents (frontend, backend, perf, code-review, verification, oracle, librarian, codebase explorer) typically keep body-level `Skill()` calls — they're routing-dependent and would waste context preloading prompt-engineering content. Audit per-agent: if removing the skill would break >50% of invocations, preload it.

---

## 9. Application-level prompt engineering

When the host project gains an AI feature (copy gen, RAG over docs, structured extraction):

- **Patterns** (XML structuring, few-shot, CoT, structured output via tool-use, prompt caching, eval-driven prompting): `references/prompt_engineering_patterns.md`.
- **Eval harnesses** (frozen test sets, graders, Karpathy autoresearch loop, RAG-specific metrics): `references/llm_evaluation_frameworks.md`.

For Karpathy-style optimize loops over a target prompt / skill, prefer a project-bound autoresearch skill (frozen harness, append-only `experiments.tsv`, crash discipline) over rolling custom scaffolding.

For migrating Claude API code or building new Anthropic SDK apps, prefer the `claude-api` skill (it auto-triggers on `@anthropic-ai/sdk` imports).

## 11. Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Vague description | Skill/agent never auto-triggers | Front-load use case + trigger phrases |
| SKILL.md > 500 lines | Context budget waste; Anthropic doc warns "Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines" | Move detail to `references/<topic>.md` |
| Re-declared Context Handoff in agent body | Drift between agents | Link to `references/agent-handoff-contracts.md` |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` on a skill listed in `skills:` preload | Silently skipped | Remove the flag (or invoke skill manually only) |
| Subagent spawning subagent | Doesn't work — Anthropic spec | Use coordinator + agent team |
| Coordinator without max-iteration | Infinite REVISION_REQUIRED loops | § 7 rule (max 2 resubmits) |
| `confidence ≤ 2` proceeding without `[ASSUMED]` flag | Plans built on speculation | Per `CLAUDE.md § Stopping conditions` — flag and ask user |
| Parallel batch with ad-hoc per-agent table shape | Manual consolidation, missed findings | Single shared findings schema (§ 6) |
